FTPbucket
=========


FTPbucket is a PHP script that enables you to sync your BitBucket repository with any FTP account

INSTALLATION
------------

- Edit the config file
- Copy the deploy folder on your FTP server
- On Bitbucket>Admin>Hooks, setup a POST hook pointing to http://myserver/deploy/deploy.php

LIMITATIONS
-----------

1. The script only copies the files you are pushing. It means that if you start with this tool when you already have files in your Bitbucket repo, they won't be copied on the server. I'm looking for solutions on a full deploy. Which brings me the second point.
2. I tried to push a 160Mo repo with more than 26 000 files and the POST hook didn't like it. The limit is 1000 files/push I think. It's an unsolved issue: https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issue/7439/git-post-commit-hook-payloads-has-empty

SOLUTION : When you create a new repo on BB and need to push a lot of files, just do it. Right after, you set up the POST hook and manually copy the repo and FTPbucket files on your FTP.

MORE
----

It should work with Mercurial too but it's not tested yet.

I'm sure a lot of improvements can be made to my code so don't hesitate to fork and improve it! I would be glad to hear about your tests and issues too.

TODO
----

- Add a GUI
- Add a post-commit hook
- Add support for SSH, Github...
